# Aleesha Fuller Part 4 Disscussion about what I'd like to get out of this class.

I've been interested in programming since my boyfriend (now husband) started trying to teach himself the different languages (python, java, etc.).
I REALLY didn't understand anything he was doing or talking about, even though I thought at the time I had a good grasp on how to handle computers.
I decided to take this class to at least be able to understand the basics of the language (for personal interest, not just because my husband is doing it).
So far we've only done one homework assignment and one quiz and I feel like a completely foreign world has opened up to me.
I now have a discord account (which my husband and his brother have used for years and think it's funny that I've finally jumped on the bandwagon).
I now have a github account too, which has pleased my computer savvy father and brother. 
Thank you for the ego boost as well as a better understanding of how my computer actually works!
